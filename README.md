# 🚀 Harsh's LeetCode Journey

> “The best way to get better at coding is to solve problems. Every day.”

Welcome to my daily LeetCode problem-solving journey!  
This repository automatically syncs with my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/Harshsi17/) using the **LeetHub extension**. I solve problems in **Java**, **Python**, and **C++** — pushing boundaries and sharpening my DSA skills one day at a time.
